# Product Requirement Document: To-Do Module

## Executive Summary
The To-Do Module is a new feature for the Recipe App that provides users with a streamlined task management system. It allows users to organize tasks by day, easily move tasks between days without confirmation dialogs, and automatically roll over uncompleted tasks. The module addresses key pain points in current task management workflows, particularly around task organization, prioritization, and movement between days. Tasks can be created quickly with a "+" button on each day and edited inline for maximum efficiency. This feature will enhance the app's utility beyond recipe management, making it a more comprehensive productivity tool.

## Problem Statement
Busy users need an efficient way to organize and manage their daily tasks. Current solutions like notes apps are prone to accidental task deletion, lack proper categorization, and don't provide automatic task rollover. Users need a more robust task management system that maintains the simplicity of a daily task list while adding safeguards against accidental deletion and providing better organization capabilities. The system should focus on task completion rather than deletion as the primary way to handle finished tasks.

## Success Metrics
- **User Adoption**: 50% of active app users engage with the To-Do module within 3 months of launch
- **Task Management**: Users create an average of 5+ tasks per week
- **Retention**: 30% increase in overall app retention rate
- **User Satisfaction**: 80% of users report satisfaction with the To-Do module functionality
- **Error Reduction**: 90% reduction in accidental task deletions compared to previous solutions

## User Personas

### Primary Persona: The Busy Professional
**Name**: Alex
**Age**: 32
**Occupation**: Project Manager
**Tech Savvy**: Medium-High

**Behaviors and Needs**:
- Juggles multiple projects and personal responsibilities
- Currently uses a notes app to track daily tasks
- Struggles with accidentally deleting tasks when reorganizing
- Needs to categorize tasks by project type (Roo Vet, Roo Code, Personal)
- Values efficiency and minimal friction in task management
- Wants to ensure important tasks don't get forgotten

**Goals**:
- Maintain clear visibility of tasks for each day
- Easily reorganize tasks within and across days as priorities shift
- Prevent accidental task deletion
- Track task completion over time
- Ensure uncompleted tasks aren't forgotten

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Daily Task Management
1. **Opening the App**: Alex opens the app in the morning and navigates to the To-Do module
2. **Viewing Today's Tasks**: The app displays today's date at the top with all tasks for the day, including those rolled over from previous days (marked as rolled over)
3. **Adding New Tasks**: Alex clicks the "+" button on today's list and quickly types in several new tasks, categorizing them as "Roo Code" and marking one as high priority
4. **Completing Tasks**: Throughout the day, Alex checks off completed tasks
5. **End of Day**: At the end of the day, only uncompleted tasks automatically roll over to the next day, while completed tasks remain on the day they were completed

### Journey 2: Task Reorganization
1. **Reprioritizing**: Alex realizes a task scheduled for tomorrow needs to be done today
2. **Moving the Task**: Alex drags the task from tomorrow's list to today's list
3. **Immediate Movement**: The task moves immediately without confirmation
4. **Successful Move**: The task appears in today's list without the "rolled over" flag since it was manually moved

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Task Management
1. Users must be able to create new tasks within any day's list via a "+" button on each day
2. Task creation must be inline, allowing users to immediately type the task title after clicking the "+" button
3. Users must be able to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
4. Users must be able to delete tasks with confirmation
5. Users must be able to edit task details inline
6. System must automatically roll over only uncompleted tasks to the next day (completed tasks remain on the day they were completed)
7. Rolled-over tasks must be visually indicated as such
8. Manual movement of tasks must clear the "rolled over" flag

#### Task Organization
1. Tasks must be organized in a vertical scrolling list of days
2. Today's tasks must appear at the top of the list
3. Users must be able to scroll up to see previous days and down to see future days
4. Users must be able to drag and drop tasks between days without confirmation dialogs
5. Users must be able to reorder tasks within a day using drag and drop without confirmation
6. Users must be able to mark tasks as high priority
7. Users must be able to categorize tasks as "Roo Vet", "Roo Code", or "Personal"
8. Categories must be visually distinct (e.g., through colors or icons)

#### Task History
1. Completed tasks must be archived rather than deleted

#### User Interface
1. The module must open to today's date by default
2. The interface must clearly indicate the current date and day of the week
3. The interface must provide visual differentiation between days
4. High priority tasks must be visually distinct
5. The interface must provide clear feedback for all user actions

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
1. Task operations (create, complete, move) must complete in under 500ms
2. The module must support at least 1000 tasks per user without performance degradation
3. Scrolling through days must be smooth with no visible lag

#### Reliability
1. Task data must not be lost due to app crashes or network issues
2. The module must function properly offline and sync when connection is restored

#### Usability
1. The drag and drop interface must be intuitive with smooth movement between days
2. The module must be accessible according to WCAG 2.1 AA standards
3. The module must be usable on both mobile and desktop devices

#### Security
1. Task data must be securely stored and associated with the user's account
2. Task data must be included in any data export functionality

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Points
1. The To-Do module will be integrated into the existing app navigation structure
2. The module will use the existing authentication system
3. No direct integration with the Recipe module is required at this time

### Data Model
1. Task entity will include:
   - Unique identifier
   - Title
   - Status (complete/incomplete)
   - Due date
   - Category (Roo Vet, Roo Code, Personal)
   - Priority flag
   - Creation timestamp
   - Completion timestamp
   - Rolled over flag
   - User ID (foreign key)

### Backend Requirements
1. API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks
2. Endpoint for moving tasks between dates
3. Scheduled job to handle automatic task rollover at midnight

### Frontend Requirements
1. React components for task list, task item, and task creation
2. Drag and drop functionality without confirmation dialogs
3. Inline editing for task titles and properties
4. State management for task data
5. Offline support using local storage

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Design
1. Maintain consistency with the existing app design language
2. Use color coding for different task categories:
   - Roo Vet: Blue
   - Roo Code: Green
   - Personal: Purple
3. Use a star or similar icon to indicate high priority tasks
4. Use subtle visual indicators for rolled-over tasks (e.g., italic text or a small icon)
5. Each day should have a clearly visible "+" button for adding new tasks
6. New task creation should have a visible text input field that appears when the "+" button is clicked

### Interaction Design
1. Implement drag and drop with visual feedback during the drag operation
2. Support both vertical reordering within a day and movement between days
3. Provide confirmation dialogs only for task deletion, not for moving or reordering tasks
4. Include an undo feature for accidental task deletions
5. Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile use
