  status            String    // "complete" or "incomplete"
  dueDate           DateTime
  category          String    // "Roo Vet", "Roo Code", "Personal"
  isPriority        Boolean   @default(false)
  createdAt         DateTime  @default(now())
  completedAt       DateTime?
  isRolledOver      Boolean   @default(false)
  displayOrder      Int       // For ordering tasks within a day
  
  // Relations
  userId            String
  user              User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])

- React DnD
- Custom implementation

**Recommendation:** Use react-beautiful-dnd for its excellent support for lists and smooth animations.

### 5.2 State Management Approach

**Options:**
- Context API (existing in the app)
- Redux
- Zustand
- React Query for server state

**Recommendation:** Use Context API for consistency with the existing app, combined with React Query for server state management.

### 5.3 Task Rollover Implementation

**Options:**
- Client-side rollover on app open
- Server-side scheduled job
- Hybrid approach

**Recommendation:** Implement a server-side scheduled job for reliability, with client-side fallback for offline users.

### 5.4 Offline Support Strategy

**Options:**
- Local Storage
- IndexedDB
- Service Worker with Cache API

**Recommendation:** Use a combination of Local Storage for simple data and IndexedDB for larger datasets, with a syncing mechanism when connection is restored.

### 5.5 Date Handling Library

**Options:**
- date-fns
- Moment.js
- Day.js
- Native Date API

**Recommendation:** Use date-fns for its modular approach and better performance compared to Moment.js.

## 6. Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive approach to developing the To-Do module for the Recipe App. By leveraging the Boomerang orchestrator mode to coordinate between different specialized modes, we can efficiently implement the various aspects of the module while ensuring high quality and adherence to requirements.

The incremental implementation sequence ensures that value is delivered at each stage, with core functionality implemented first, followed by enhanced features, advanced features, and finally refinements based on testing and user feedback.

Before implementation begins, key technical decisions should be finalized to ensure a smooth development process and consistent approach across the module.
