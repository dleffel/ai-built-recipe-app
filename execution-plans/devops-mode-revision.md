# DevOps Mode Revision Plan

## Current Issues
- Role definition is extremely lengthy and verbose
- Heavy focus on cultural aspects and team alignment
- Contains many sections that could be condensed
- Includes detailed implementation steps that could be moved to separate documentation

## Proposed Changes

### Core Focus Areas
1. Infrastructure & Cloud
2. CI/CD Pipeline
3. Monitoring & Observability
4. Security & Compliance
5. Automation & Scaling
6. Incident Response

### New Role Definition Structure
The new definition will:
- Focus primarily on technical responsibilities
- Emphasize automation and infrastructure as code
- Maintain high standards while being more concise
- Keep critical security and reliability requirements
- Remove lengthy cultural and process descriptions

### Implementation Plan
1. Create a more focused roleDefinition that emphasizes technical expertise
2. Move detailed implementation guides to separate documentation
3. Maintain all tool access groups (read, edit, browser, command, mcp)
4. Preserve core DevOps principles while reducing verbosity

## Proposed New Role Definition
