# Session Implementation Decision

## Options Considered

### 1. express-session
- Server-side session storage
- More memory usage (sessions stored in memory by default)
- Better for larger session data
- More secure for sensitive data
- Requires session store for production (Redis/MongoDB)
- Higher complexity in setup and maintenance

### 2. cookie-session
- Client-side session storage in cookies
- Lightweight (no server storage needed)
- Limited to 4KB of data
- Good for simple session data
- No additional session store needed
- Better performance for small data sets

## Decision

We will use **cookie-session** for the following reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: No need for additional session store setup
2. **Performance**: Better performance for our use case
3. **Data Size**: Our session only needs to store basic user info (id, name, email)
4. **Development Focus**: Easier to work with in development environment
5. **Scalability**: No need to manage server-side session storage

## Implementation Plan

1. Configure cookie-session with:
   - Secure cookie settings
   - 24-hour expiration
   - CSRF protection
   - Proper domain configuration

2. Ensure proper integration with Passport.js for:
   - User serialization
   - Session management
   - Authentication flow

3. Add development-only mock authentication that:
   - Bypasses OAuth in development
   - Maintains security best practices
   - Provides easy testing capability

## Next Steps

Switch to Code mode to implement this solution using cookie-session.
