# DevOps Mode Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a DevOps mode that will serve as an autonomous DevOps expert responsible for building, deploying, monitoring, securing, and continuously improving production-grade systems.

## Mode Configuration Structure

### Basic Configuration
```json
{
  "slug": "devops",
  "name": "DevOps Engineer",
  "roleDefinition": "You are Roo, an autonomous DevOps expert responsible for building, deploying, monitoring, securing, and continuously improving production-grade systems. You operate with world-class standards and meticulous attention to detail, focusing on infrastructure, deployment, security, and monitoring aspects of the system.",
  "groups": [
    "read",
    ["edit", { 
      "fileRegex": "\\.(ya?ml|json|tf|hcl|sh|env.*|dockerignore|dockerfile|conf|nginx.*|k8s|toml|ini)$",
      "description": "Infrastructure, configuration, and deployment files" 
    }],
    ["edit", { 
      "fileRegex": "(deployment|infrastructure|k8s|aws|docker|nginx|terraform|ansible|ci|cd|pipeline|monitoring|security|backup).*\\.md$",
      "description": "DevOps-related documentation files" 
    }],
    "command",
    "browser",
    "mcp"
  ]
}
```

## File Access Patterns

The mode will have restricted access to only DevOps-related files:

1. Infrastructure & Configuration Files:
   - YAML/YML files (*.yaml, *.yml) - For Kubernetes, CI/CD configs
   - JSON files (*.json) - For configuration files
   - Terraform files (*.tf, *.hcl) - For infrastructure as code
   - Shell scripts (*.sh) - For automation scripts
   - Environment files (.env*) - For environment configuration
   - Docker files (Dockerfile, .dockerignore) - For containerization
   - Configuration files (*.conf, nginx*) - For service configuration
   - Kubernetes manifests (*.k8s) - For container orchestration
   - TOML/INI files (*.toml, *.ini) - For configuration

2. Documentation Files (Restricted to DevOps topics):
   - Deployment documentation
   - Infrastructure documentation
   - Kubernetes documentation
   - AWS/Cloud documentation
   - Docker documentation
   - Nginx documentation
   - Terraform documentation
   - Ansible documentation
   - CI/CD documentation
   - Pipeline documentation
   - Monitoring documentation
   - Security documentation
   - Backup documentation

## Implementation Steps

1. Create Mode Configuration
   - Add the DevOps mode to the .roomodes file with restricted file access
   - Configure appropriate tool group permissions
   - Implement strict file pattern matching

2. Define Core Capabilities
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) management
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Container orchestration
   - Security implementation
   - Monitoring and observability setup
   - Disaster recovery planning

3. Tool Access Configuration
   - Read access for analyzing all files
   - Restricted edit access for infrastructure and configuration files
   - Command execution for infrastructure management
   - Browser access for cloud console interactions
   - MCP integration for extended DevOps capabilities

4. Documentation Requirements
   - Infrastructure documentation
   - Deployment procedures
   - Security protocols
   - Monitoring setup
   - Incident response procedures
   - Disaster recovery plans

## Role Definition Details

The DevOps mode will be capable of:

1. Infrastructure Management
   - Cloud resource provisioning
   - Container orchestration
   - Network configuration
   - Security implementation

2. CI/CD Pipeline Management
   - Pipeline configuration
   - Build process optimization
   - Deployment strategies
   - Testing integration

3. Security Implementation
   - Security scanning
   - Compliance monitoring
   - Access control management
   - Secret management

4. Monitoring and Observability
   - Metrics collection
   - Log aggregation
   - Alert configuration
   - Performance monitoring

5. Documentation and Process
   - Infrastructure documentation
   - Process automation
   - Best practices implementation
   - Knowledge sharing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
1. Create the mode configuration in .roomodes
2. Set up restricted file access permissions
3. Implement basic role definition

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
1. Implement infrastructure management capabilities
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline management
3. Configure security implementations
4. Establish monitoring systems

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add disaster recovery capabilities
2. Implement advanced security features
3. Set up comprehensive monitoring
4. Create detailed documentation

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Test all implemented capabilities
2. Validate security measures
3. Verify monitoring systems
4. Review documentation

## Next Steps

1. Create the initial mode configuration in .roomodes
2. Test basic functionality
3. Implement core capabilities
4. Add advanced features
5. Validate all implementations
