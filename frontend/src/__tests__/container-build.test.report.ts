/**
 * QA Test Report: Frontend Container Build
 * Date: 2/24/2025
 * 
 * Test Results Summary:
 * - Total Tests: 6
 * - Passed: 5
 * - Failed: 1
 * 
 * Failed Test Details:
 * 1. Dockerfile Configuration Test
 *    - Expected optimized container configuration
 *    - Found several deviations from best practices
 * 
 * Current Issues:
 * 1. Dockerfile Issues:
 *    - Using node:18 instead of node:18-alpine (larger image size)
 *    - Using npm install instead of npm ci (less deterministic builds)
 *    - NODE_ENV inconsistency (development in build stage)
 * 
 * 2. Package Issues:
 *    - 12 vulnerabilities (6 moderate, 6 high)
 *    - Several deprecated package warnings
 * 
 * 3. Development Environment:
 *    - Watchman configuration warning
 * 
 * Required Changes:
 * 1. Dockerfile Updates:
 *    - Change FROM node:18 to FROM node:18-alpine
 *    - Replace npm install with npm ci
 *    - Set NODE_ENV=production consistently
 * 
 * 2. Security Updates:
 *    - Run npm audit fix
 *    - Update deprecated packages
 * 
 * 3. Environment Configuration:
 *    - Add .watchmanconfig file
 * 
 * Passing Tests:
 * ✓ nginx.conf configuration
 * ✓ package.json structure
 * ✓ environment variables documentation
 * ✓ security headers configuration
 * ✓ health check endpoint setup
 * 
 * Impact Assessment:
 * 1. Performance:
 *    - Current base image is ~300MB larger than necessary
 *    - Build times could be inconsistent due to npm install
 * 
 * 2. Security:
 *    - Vulnerabilities need to be addressed
 *    - Security headers are properly configured
 * 
 * 3. Reliability:
 *    - Build process could be more deterministic
 *    - Health check endpoint is properly configured
 * 
 * Next Steps:
 * 1. Update Dockerfile with recommended changes
 * 2. Address package vulnerabilities
 * 3. Add development environment configurations
 * 4. Re-run tests after changes
